# message-demo Check-In


### What Updates Did I Make?

* Created a container for messages.
* Made messages appear overtop other elements with the fixed position CSS.
* Moved page information out of the way of the messages so that nothing was covered up
* Made messages have a random color
* Changed the color of the button when it gets pressed.

### Interesting things I noticed about the code

* Minor formatting issues in the HTML document, just some end tags in weird places and indentations missing.
* The JS file also had a few formatting issues.

### Suggestions for Improvements

* This project was pretty straightforward, I took the liberty of adding random colors to the messages since I had a lot of time after completion. It became a fun little side project.

### Places Where I Went Above and Beyond

* I added random colors to the messages to make them super fun!
* Messages get removed from the DOM after they fade out for performance.
